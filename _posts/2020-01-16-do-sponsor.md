I'm happy to tell that LittlevGL received another year of sponsorship from [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). 

Digital Ocean generously [supports open-source project](https://www.digitalocean.com/open-source/) with a huge amount of credits which can be spent to buy products from Digital Ocean.

We use it to run our [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) Forum in VPS (1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 50 GB SSD). It costs only half of our sponsorship so we have plenty of room to add other services too.

So **big thanks** to Digital Ocean for this awesome sponsorship program. If you also have an open-source project you can learn more about the sponsorship program [here](https://do.co/oss-sponsorship)!
