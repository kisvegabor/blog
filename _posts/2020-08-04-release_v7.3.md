**The most interesting yet very simple feature of v7.3.0 are `lv_event_send_refresh(obj)` and `lv_event_send_refresh_recursive(obj)`. They send an `LV_EVENT_REFRESH` event to an object or to all its descendants too.  `lv_event_send_refresh_recursive(NULL)` will notify all the existing objects.**

In the refresh event of an object the developer can see the current value of some variables and update the object accordingly. E.g. update the label's text to a measured value, or to the newly selected language, or set the state of a checkbox according to a boolean variable. 

The gist is you don't have to check whether the object exists or not before updating it. Just notify all objects or all children of an object and if 
an object is there, and its refresh event is implemented it will do its job.  Read more [here](https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/overview/event.html?highlight=lv_event_send_refresh#refresh-event).

### New features
- Add `lv_event_send_refresh`, `lv_event_send_refresh_recursive` to easily send `LV_EVENT_REFRESH` to object
- Add `LV_MEMCPY_MEMSET_STD` to use standard `memcpy` and `memset`
- Add `lv_tabview_set_tab_name()` function - used to change a tab's name
- Add `LV_THEME_MATERIAL_FLAG_NO_TRANSITION` and `LV_THEME_MATERIAL_FLAG_NO_FOCUS` flags
- Reduce code size by adding: `LV_USE_FONT_COMPRESSED`, `LV_FONT_USE_SUBPX`, `LV_USE_OUTLINE`, `LV_USE_PATTERN`, `LV_USE_VALUE_STR`  and applying some optimization
- Add `lv_task_get_next`

### Bugfixes
- Do not print warning for missing glyph if its height OR width is zero.
- Prevent duplicated sending of `LV_EVENT_INSERT` from text area
- Tidy outer edges of cpicker widget.
- Remove duplicated lines from `lv_tabview_add_tab`
- btnmatrix: hadle combined states of buttons (e.g. chacked + disabled)
- textarea: fix typo in lv_textarea_set_sscrollbar_mode
- gauge: fix image needle drawing
- fix using freed memory in _lv_style_list_remove_style

### Arudino library
The core lvgl repository and lv_examples are now directly available as Arduino libraries:
- https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/lvgl
- https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/lv_examples

See the [README](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/tree/master/examples/arduino) for more info.

### New repositories
- [lv_lib_gif](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_lib_gif): GIF decoder
- [lv_lib_bmp](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_lib_bmp) BMP decoder

`lv_lib_lodepng` is renamed to [lv_lib_png](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_lib_gif) for consitency
